"""Advisory state for the OMI ingest path: delivery/segment dedup + per-uid anchor.

Lives in its OWN small SQLite db on the edge (NOT ``ambient.db``). The store is ADVISORY:
losing it costs at most one duplicate row or ~2s of timestamp jitter on a single batch —
both engine-tolerable.

Three tables:
  * ``seen_segments`` — PRIMARY dedup: every real OMI segment carries a stable UUID ``id``
    (verified against a live capture), so this is the reliable cross-batch / re-send key.
  * ``idempotency_keys`` — a BONUS layer for OMI's ``Idempotency-Key`` header (reused across
    a batch's retries). The live prod capture had no such header, so this never carries the
    dedup alone; a missing/empty key is simply never a duplicate.
  * ``anchor`` — the per-uid ``(epoch0, max_end)`` reconstructed wall-clock anchor.

All age logic is driven by a caller-supplied ``now`` so callers stay wall-clock independent
(and testable). Access is serialized by the ingest service's single data-path lock, so one
shared connection is safe.
