    """Converts firmware ``{"type": "interrupt"}`` messages into interruptions.

    The Voice PE firmware sends an interrupt text frame when the user barges
    in via the wake word during bot speech (it also stops its own speaker
    locally). This processor completes the server side:

    1. Cancels the in-flight OpenAI response. The service only does this
       itself when turn detection is disabled (``_handle_interruption``);
       with semantic VAD the server cancels on ``speech_started``, which
       never fires for client-side interrupts because the firmware mic gate
       blocked the wake word audio.
    2. Broadcasts an ``InterruptionFrame`` — truncates the OpenAI context,
       flushes queued output audio, and (via the output transport +
       ``RawAudioSerializer``) echoes the interrupt back to the device.
